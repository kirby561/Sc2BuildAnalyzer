To update s2protocol:
1) git clone https://github.com/Blizzard/s2protocol.git
2) Delete the old s2protocol in Dependencies
3) Copy s2protocol/s2protocol into the Dependencies folder (You don't need the build/.git/docs/etc.. directories).
4) Copy the LICENSE file into the s2protocol folder (We want to keep this with the source).
